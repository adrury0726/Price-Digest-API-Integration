# Price-Digest-API-Integration

The purpose of this project was to integrate Price Digest into our company's website. This was done by writing code in C# in order to do the API calls. In this project, I established a database connection, creating error logging, and would pull the data from the API calls and store them into our SQL Server tables. From there, I'd take the data and create numerous stored procedures that were being used in order to insert, update, and select the data for display. I hope you enjoy this project I was able to put together for our company!

This is a professional API I integrated for Pawnee Leasing Corporation. This was the first time I really had the opportunity to showcase my C# skills and professionally integrate an API with our website.
