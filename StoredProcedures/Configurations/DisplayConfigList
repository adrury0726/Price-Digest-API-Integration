This sproc is being built in order to display the configuration options that the user can select from.

This sproc was a little more difficult, as there are some limitations to the website platform we use,
which made it difficult to display the data properly on our website. However, the way our website is built,
we are able to add html/css within our stored procedures to change the formatting a little bit. 
I made it so that it would display the Specvalues as a red font and got it to list out per configurationID (unique identifier).
